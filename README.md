Stopwatch Web Application Project - Completed! Excited to share my second task at Prodigy InfoTech - a fully functional stopwatch web application! Leveraged the power of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to craft an interactive and user-friendly experience.

Key Features: Structured Design: Utilized HTML to seamlessly organize and structure the application's elements. Dynamic Styling: Enhanced user experience with CSS for a visually appealing and responsive design. Functionalities Galore: Implemented JavaScript functions for starting, pausing, and resetting the stopwatch. Lap Time Tracking: Users can now accurately measure and record time intervals with the added lap time feature.

Tech Stack: HTML CSS JavaScript

How It Works: Start: Initiate the stopwatch to begin tracking time. Pause: Halt the timer at any point for convenience. Reset: Clear and restart the stopwatch for a fresh timing session. Lap Times: Track and display lap times for precise interval measurements.

Learning Journey: This project has been an incredible opportunity to deepen my understanding of web development. Grateful to Prodigy InfoTech for fostering an environment of continuous learning.
